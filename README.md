Creating FAKE REST API using the json-server npm package

Initially
1. Run npm init command to create a package.json file.
2. Run npm i json-server command to download the json-server package.


We may need dummy or fake APIs
  - to test an application with a ready frontend.
  - to create a prototype for a backend work we are considering.
  - to make requests for different HTTP methods on an API platform like Postman.
